# The OluÅ› Programming Language

## Get up and running

```
git clone git@github.com:olus-lang/olus-lang.git
cd olus-lang
stack build
stack exec -- olus -i ./examples/demo.olus
```

## TODO

- [ ] Compute which closures can be in which variables as a list of candidates.
      ```
      if condition then else: ...
      # 'if' can be 'if'
      # call can be 'then' or 'else'
      ```

- [ ] Recognize unary closures and turn them into infinite precision integers. (N = Z | S N).
